# DL_projects
Here you can find some small projects I`ve done during learning interesting topics.



## PyTorch

[MLP for MNIST classification](./notebooks/2_2_MNIST_and_MLP_PyTorch.ipynb) [Open in collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DCzhmkVo8bEypsUG1OPsPV3ZsDTv_qZD)
- Simple example of MLP using to solve digits classification problem.

[Simple style transfer with PyTorch](./notebooks/Style_transfer.ipynb) [Open in collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QKmQ25WqCzD6EeOQhThgKNRBo2_dEnD8)
- Applying VGG pretraining encoder to solve style transfer problem. Fell free to fork and use it to style your own photos!

[Face detector based on CNN from dlib + embeddings taking](./notebooks/Face_detecting_and_embeddings_with_dlib.ipynb) [Open in collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A8E8d2_9ie-YYiGZLMWbhIxq8MDaituT)
- There is no training of CNN. The task sounds like make a face detection system and return embeddings of each face. Use dlib pretrained model to do this.
