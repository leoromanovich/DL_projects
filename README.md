# DL_projects
Here you can find some small projects I`ve done during learning interesting topics.



## PyTorch

[MLP for MNIST classification](./notebooks/2_2_MNIST_and_MLP_PyTorch.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/leoromanovich/DL_projects/blob/master/notebooks/2_2_MNIST_and_MLP_PyTorch.ipynb)

- Simple example of MLP using to solve digits classification problem.

[Simple style transfer with PyTorch](./notebooks/Style_transfer.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/leoromanovich/DL_projects/blob/master/notebooks/Style_transfer.ipynb)
- Applying VGG pretraining encoder to solve style transfer problem. Fell free to fork and use it to style your own photos!

[Face detector based on CNN from dlib + embeddings taking](./notebooks/Face_detecting_and_embeddings_with_dlib.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/leoromanovich/DL_projects/blob/master/notebooks/Face_detecting_and_embeddings_with_dlib.ipynb)
- There is no training of CNN. The task sounds like make a face detection system and return embeddings of each face. Use dlib pretrained model to do this.
